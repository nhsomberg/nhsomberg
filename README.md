I'm a chemistry PhD candidate in my fifth year at MIT. I study supramolecular assemblies with solid-state NMR in the lab of Mei Hong. I'm particularly interested in probing the structure and dynamics of complex biological solids by developing new 19F and 31P NMR techniques, in addition to 13C,15N,1H methods. My current projects focus on the structure, mechanism, and drug inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope protein.
